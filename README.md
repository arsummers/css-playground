# css-playground

  I made these file so I can continue practicing and playing with my CSS skills.

  My goal is to set up the same layout three times - once using floats, once using flexbox, once using gridbox

  I will also use this to practice my CSS selectors

  If I get ambitious I may also add animations

  My goal is to keep all my CSS in the three main SMACSS style folders
